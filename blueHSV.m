function BW = blueHSV(RGB)
%createMask  Threshold RGB image using auto-generated code from colorThresholder app.
%  BW = createMask(RGB) thresholds image RGB using
%  auto-generated code from the colorThresholder app. The colorspace and
%  range for each channel of the colorspace were set within the app. The
%  segmentation mask is returned in BW, and a composite of the mask and
%  original RGB images is returned in maskedRGBImage.
